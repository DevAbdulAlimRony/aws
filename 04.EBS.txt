- An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run. It allows our instances to persist data, even after their termination. They can only be mounted to one instance at a time. They are bound to a specific availability zone.

- Free Tier: 30 GB of free EBS storage of type generale purpose

- It is a network drive. It uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency. It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly. To move a volume zone, we first need to snapshot it.

- Preserve root volume when instance is terminated. By default, the root EBS volume is deleted(attribute enabled), any other not deleted.

- Backup- snapshot

- AMI: Amazon Machine Image. AMI are a customization of an EC2 instance. We can add our own software, configuration, operating system, monitoring. Faster boot/configuration
